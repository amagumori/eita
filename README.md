### ProceduralBuildingGenerator

### About
This project was created as a part of my bachelor's thesis at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Computer Science and Information Technology Osijek

The thesis will be made available some time in the future in Croatian, with the summary available in English.   
I might rewrite the thesis in English as well(big maybe here)

Blender 2.8 support is planned once it is released and stable  

### Installation

Copy the ProceduralBuildingGenerator to your addons folder  
This addon requires no additional python libraries.  

### Usage
The addon has it's own toolbar in the toolshelf panel  
After changing parameters, you can click generate to generate a building  
WARNING: using unreasonably large values might cause blender to crash due to lack of memory  
WARNING: using incompatible param values might cause blender to crash due to no validation existing.  
NOTE: delete the previous building before generating the new one to see the changes better.  
Consult the wiki to see exactly what each parameter does
